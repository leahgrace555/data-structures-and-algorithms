# Singly linked list

## Challenge:

need to create a LinkedList.Node class with properties for the value stored in the LinkedList.Node and pointer to next LinkedList.Node

In the linkedList class, include a head property

define a method called insert that takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list

define a method called includes that takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean if that value exists as a node

 define a method called toString that returns a string of all the values in the linked list
format: "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL
